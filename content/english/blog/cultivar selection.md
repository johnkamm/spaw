Selecting the right cannabis cultivar(s) for outdoor cultivation in Michigan requires careful consideration of several factors, including climate, growing season length, & resistance to pests + mold.

## 1. Climate Adaptability
Michigan has a temperate climate with cold winters and humid summers. The outdoor growing season typically runs from **late May to early October**, meaning cultivars should mature before the first frost.

- **Indica-Dominant or Hybrid Cultivars:** These have shorter flowering times (**7-9 weeks**) and can finish before Michigan’s first frost in early October.
- **Sativa-Dominant Strains:** These often have longer flowering times (**10-14 weeks**) and may struggle to finish before cold weather unless autoflowering genetics are used.

## 2. Mold and Pest Resistance
Michigan’s humid summers increase the risk of mold, mildew, and pest infestations. Cultivars with strong resistance to **powdery mildew, botrytis (bud rot), and other pests** are crucial.

- **Resilient Strains:** Older strains such as **Durban Poison, Blue Dream, Northern Lights, and White Widow** are known for their mold resistance.
- **Airy Bud Structure:** Avoid overly dense buds that retain moisture and increase mold risk.

## 3. Autoflowering vs. Photoperiod Strains
- **Autoflowering Strains:** These flower based on age rather than light cycle, typically finishing in **8-12 weeks from seed**. They are a great option for Michigan’s short season.
- **Photoperiod Strains:** Require a full season, but selecting early-finishing varieties (**ready by late September to early October**) is essential.

## Recommended Outdoor Strains for Michigan
- **Northern Lights** (Indica-dominant, short flowering, mold-resistant)
- **Durban Poison** (Sativa, early finishing, mold-resistant)
- **Gorilla Glue #4** (Hybrid, high yield, hardy)
- **Blue Dream** (Hybrid, adaptable, mold-resistant)
- **Super Skunk** (Indica-dominant, fast flowering, resilient)
- **White Widow** (Hybrid, mold-resistant, early flowering)
- **Amnesia Haze Auto** (Autoflowering, great for short seasons)

By choosing cultivars suited to Michigan’s growing conditions, one can **maximize yield and quality while minimizing risks**.
