COGS in the cannabis industry refers to the direct costs associated with producing and cultivating cannabis products that are sold by licensed operators. In Michigan, these costs are essential for calculating profitability and determining how much revenue is needed to cover expenses.

## Components of COGS in Cultivation:

1. **Labor Costs:**
   - Wages and benefits for employees working in cultivation, such as growers, trimmers, and other staff involved in the production process.

2. **Seeds and Clones:**
   - The cost of purchasing seeds or clones that are used to start the cultivation process, including expenses for breeding or acquiring specialized genetics.

3. **Nutrients and Soil:**
   - Costs for growing mediums (e.g., soil, coco coir, or hydroponic systems) and the nutrients required to nourish the plants.

4. **Water and Utilities:**
   - The cost of water for irrigation and electricity/other utilities required to maintain optimal growing conditions (e.g., lighting, HVAC systems, dehumidifiers).

5. **Pesticides and Pest Management:**
   - Costs for pest control measures to ensure healthy crops free from pests or diseases, which may include organic or synthetic methods.

6. **Packaging and Storage:**
   - Costs related to packaging materials for the harvested product and storage before sale or further processing.

7. **Overhead Costs in the Facility:**
   - Expenses for maintaining the cultivation facility, including rent, insurance, and depreciation on equipment used in the growing process.

## Importance of COGS:
- **Gross Margin Calculation:** Properly tracking COGS helps cannabis businesses determine gross margin and assess the efficiency of their cultivation processes.
- **Profitability Assessment:** COGS allows businesses to adjust strategies and operations to maximize profitability.
- **Compliance with State Regulations:** Cannabis businesses in Michigan must ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements while managing COGS.
